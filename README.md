GAME,TEST_EXAMPLE,"Hello, world!",Witaj Å“wiecie!,Hallo Welt!,Anything you wish to type
```

* **Namespace** - a namespace in which current entry is located. This column is **optional**, but without it a **Global Namespace** must be defined.
* **Key** - a key of this entry, used later in text implementation.
* **lang-x** - a value in a **x** language. **x** is a language code, such as *en*, *pl*, *de*, etc.
* **Comments** - just a row for comments

> !!! IMPORTANT !!!  
> **Namespace** and **Key** must be first columns. The order of other columns doesn't matter.  
> Any column that isn't **Namespace**, **Key** or **lang-x** is ignored by the tool.

* **Global Namespace** - this namespace will be assigned to every key in localization.


### Import

In order to import localization from CSV simply select the CSV file in the tool's window and click **Import**.  
If your CSV doesn't have a **Namespace** column, fill **Globl Namespace** property. That's it!
