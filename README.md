## CSV Format

The tool accepts a CSV file of a defined format:

![csvtesteg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/143495161-338a59b2-a41f-43a2-85cb-6a3b28078ab1.png)

``` csv
Namespace,Key,lang-en,lang-pl,lang-de,Comments
GAME,TEST_EXAMPLE,"Hello, world!",Witaj Å›wiecie!,Hallo Welt!,Anything you wish to type
```

* **Namespace** - a namespace in which current entry is located. This column is **optional**, but without it a **Global Namespace** must be defined.
* **Key** - a key of this entry, used later in text implementation.
* **lang-x** - a value in a **x** language. **x** is a language code, such as *en*, *pl*, *de*, etc.
* **Comments** - just a row for comments

> !!! IMPORTANT !!!  
> **Namespace** and **Key** must be first columns. The order of other columns doesn't matter.  
> Any column that isn't **Namespace**, **Key** or **lang-x** is ignored by the tool.

## Using the Tool

To open the tool select `Window -> Easy Localization Tool` or use a shortcut `Alt + Shift + L`

![open](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/143495187-8ceab883-f00f-463b-af32-0effd64f642b.png)

The following window should appear:

![elttoolwindow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/143495192-da02d1ac-cee3-4792-8a63-db6e4f748fda.png)

* **Localization Name** - Name of currently selected Localization. The game can have multiple localization directories.
* **Available Languages in Selected Localization** - list of language codes that are implemented in selected localization directory.
* **Available Languages** - list of language codes that are implemented by every localization directory.
* **Reimport on editor startup** - reimports the lastly selected localization with the last used CSV file when editor starts.
* **Localization Preview** - enabled the preview of the localization in the editor.
* **Override Language on Startup** - if enabled, when the game starts for the very first time the selected language will be used. Normally, the system language will be used or it will fallback to `en`.
* **CSV File** - CSV file to import.
* **Global Namespace** - this namespace will be assigned to every key in localization.

## Import

In order to import localization from CSV simply select the CSV file in the tool's window and click **Import**.  
If your CSV doesn't have a **Namespace** column, fill **Globl Namespace** property. That's it!

## Using Localizations

In order to use a localized phrase type a key into the Text value:

![testex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/144485825-09cc1e5e-408d-48c4-adab-9fda9d7e51d7.png)

Then, set a Namespace and Key values for this Text:

![testex2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/144485826-ede6dd9f-c7d8-42b5-a615-6f2d67f21816.png)

To use it in a c++ code use the following macro:

``` cpp
NSLOCTEXT("GAME", "TEST_EXAMPLE", "TEST_EXAMPLE")
```

## LocText Struct

There is an unwanted behaviour of `FText` - it keeps creating a new Key for every child Blueprint it's in.  
It means that if there is a `FText` in a Blueprint, this `FText` will not be valid in this Blueprints's children.  

In order to workaround this issue the `FLocText` has been introduce. It is a structure that holds Namespace and Key and it can give a corresponding to it `FText`. The structrue is immune to the inheritence problems.  

``` cpp
FLocText LocalizedStruct("GAME", "TEST_EXAMPLE");
FText LocalizedText = LocalizedStruct.GetText();
FString LocalizedString = LocalizedStruct.ToString();
```
Struct is supported in Blueprints too, of course.

## Previewing Localizations

You can use **Localization Preview** option in the tool, or use the Preview option inside UMG Designer

![preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/144485817-09998bdb-a27b-4d10-b139-4db271880996.png)

## Controlling Localizations

Easy Localization Tool comes with few handy functions to control localization in game:

#### Get Available Languages

Returns a list of available language codes.

![elt1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/144485828-52dabe7a-ecc9-48db-a39b-a65a2f877987.png)

``` cpp
GetELT()->GetAvailableLanguages();
```

#### Get Current Language

Returns a code of the language which is currently in use.

![elt2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/144485830-87f4cbe1-97f8-46cc-b740-40aad0e5c00e.png)

``` cpp
GetELT()->GetCurrentLanguage();
```

#### Can Set Language

Checks if a language with the given language code can be set.

![elt3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/144485831-2e02ea40-96d5-4304-ba4d-ce1eeccd2825.png)

``` cpp
GetELT()->CanSetLanguage("en");
```

#### Set Language

Sets a language with the given language code. Returns false if the language couldn't be set.

![elt4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/144485832-8c3c42e5-3e28-402c-a695-f2af39b9628e.png)

``` cpp
GetELT()->SetLanguage("en");
```

#### On Text Localization Changed Event

Allow to bind delegate which will run every time a Text Localization has been changed.

![locchange](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/152312310-7beafb2b-616b-4cfe-b757-305519985721.png)

``` cpp
GetELT()->OnTextLocalizationChanged.AddDynamic(this, &UMyObject::OnTextLocalizationChangedUFunc);
```
or
``` cpp
GetELT()->OnTextLocalizationChangedStatic.AddLambda([this]()
{
    // Stuff to do when localization has changed.
});
```

## Save File

Easy Localization Tool saves lastly used language and sets it when starting a game.  
The save file is located in `MyGame\Saved\SaveGames\ELTSave.sav`

[Back to top](#table-of-content)

## Commandlet

You can generate localization without starting the editor, but via command line.  
It might be useful when building a game via CI platform like Jenkins.

You can use the following script (win64) to generate localization files:

```
set UE4_PATH=C:\E4
set PROJECT_PATH=C:\MyGame

call %UE4_PATH%\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor-Cmd.exe %PROJECT_PATH%\MyGame.uproject -run=ELTCommandlet -CSVPath=%PROJECT_PATH%\Lockit.csv -LocPath=%PROJECT_PATH%\Content\Localization\Game -Namespace=GAME
```

Where:

* **-CSVPath** - is a path to the csv file to import.
* **-LocPath** - is a directory where localization files should be stored.
* **-Namespace** - optional parameter which sets a **Global Namespace** value.

## Utilities

#### Get Text Data

Gets a Package, Namespace, Key and Source info from FText.

![getinfo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/168045473-d05f9138-736d-4c3c-96d8-1b5b8ade2556.png)

#### Validate Text

*This is Editor Scripting only utility.*  
It checks if the given FText is properly localized - it means it checks if Source and Key are the same. It will return false if given FText is empty.

![validtxt2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/168045759-8fd19a3e-9c39-4363-9664-a76945afa768.png)

#### Validate Text

*This is Editor Scripting only utility.*  
It fixes the given FText if it's not properly localized. It will return the fixed FText via OutText parameter. It will return false if the InText is empty or it doesn't have to be fixed.

![fixttxt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7863125/168045994-91f0499a-63c4-440e-be29-cdd8bacca087.png)
